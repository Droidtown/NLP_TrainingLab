Agrawal said that Twitter's leadership would seek to find time for employees to ask questions directly of Musk. He added that he expects to spend time with Musk and will tell the billionaire about the principles that have guided Twitter's decisions.
In response to the question about whether Trump's account — which was removed from Twitter early last year for violating its policies on inciting violence following the Capitol Riot — would be restored on the platform, Agrawal told staff that is something they should ask Musk and said, "once the deal closes, we will know what direction the platform will go."
One employee asked what Musk's takeover could mean for Twitter's "commitment to responsible, ethical" artificial intelligence and machine learning, saying, "we've been viewed as industry leaders in this field and have attracted some of the field's best and brightest minds, but it would seem that new ownership's values are not in alignment."
Agrawal called such work "critical for Twitter to be able to serve our customers" and said "we need to continue doing that work."
Other employees asked what Musk's takeover could mean for employee retention and attrition. The deal comes at a time when there is already heightened competition for talent in the labor market, especially in the tech industry.
