POWs being asked to fight for Russia - Ukraine defence ministry

Ukraine's ministry of defence, has in its latest update claimed that Ukrainian prisoners of war are being approached to fight for Russian forces, due to an urgent need to replenish depleted units in the south-eastern region of Rostov.

It added that Russia is appearing to enlist even those with no military experience.

The BBC has been unable to verify these claims.

The statement from the ministry added that there have been reports of Russian forces robbing and executing civilians, in violation of international law.

It added that pro-Russian messages are being spread in Russian-controlled territories, in an attempt to negotiate with local populations.

The statement also said that in the southern Ukrainian territory of Kherson, Russian forces have made attempts to install an police-administrated area, creating a system of commanders to maintain "order" in temporarily occupied settlements
